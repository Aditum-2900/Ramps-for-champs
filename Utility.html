                                Aditum is a company that believes at its core in equity for all. While there have been significant improvements for the impaired population's quality of life, we are far from done. Not all buildings are wheelchair accessible nor is that a realistic goal to achieve. Furthermore, many "wheelchair accessible" utilities are more prone to failure; for instnace, elevators malfunction on a weekly basis and are susceptable to power outages. Therefore, we stand to create newer technologies to adress the needs of our challenged population in a more sustainable permanent manner

                                We have noticed that many wheelchair-bound individuals are capable of being completely self dependent unless stairs are present. While discarding stairs from all facilities is unrealistic, and upgrading all locations into a "wheelchair accessible" format is a distant goal, what if we upgraded the wheelchair itself?</br>
                                The wheelchair has not seen many updates for centuries. While the appearance of wheelchairs has changed vastly, the functionality of the wheelchair unfortunately has not. This prompted our team to introduce a new product into the game. Introducing: <a id="productsLink1" href="Products.html"> Ramps for Champs</a>, a wheelchair with its own moveable ramp.

                              <a id="productsLink1" href="Products.html">Ramps for Champs</a> is our first and only product.
                              Its function is to traverse obstacles a regular wheelchair would never be able to overcome.
                              It supports an controllable ramp that extends up to 1.5 meters forward and can be lifted at an angle of 40°.
                              The ramp is highly adhesive to prevent the chair from slipping and it is designed to stay in place until retrived by a special mechanism in the chair.
                              The chair itself can be motorized or manual.
